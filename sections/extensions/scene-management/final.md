# Finale

You know know how the `SceneTree` and scene management works in Godot. Introducing Godot's whole UI framework in this format wouldn't be practical, so we will let you explore it yourself through making a more stylized Main Menu.

## Godot's UI Framework

If your coming from something like CSS in web development, Godot's way of doing things might seem a little unintuitive. It also is built with nodes and has hierarchical elements, just like regular old scenes are. Godot provides you with many nodes which implement UI functionality like:
- Buttons
- Labels (text)
- TextEdits & LineEdits (text boxes)

It also provides elements that allow you to format your content like:
- BoxContainers
- MarginContainers
- ScrollContainers

We aren't going to guide you through it here, as we are lazy and it would take too long in this format. Rather, we will give you some resources so you can explore it yourself.

## Resources

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hog6a0EYa0) (credits to the author, [Karto](https://www.youtube.com/@kartopod)!) gives a great intro to Godot's UI framework. The [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/ui/index.html#ui-building-blocks) also give a summary of how UI works in Godot.


Using either of those resources or any other way that you wish, go ahead and jazz up our old boring UI. You can also add:
- Extra buttons (exit, credits, etc)
- An end screen when the player finishes the game
- Pause menu in the levels??


Get as creative as you want!
