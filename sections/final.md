# Finale 
Congrats! You are done with the base of the tutorial. We also offer you some extensions you can do to gain more extensive knowledge of the engine. These describe more advanced topics like scene management, audio, shaders, particles, and resources. You should be able to do most of these in any order, but some depend on others.


Here are some that we either made or are working on:
- Levels and a Main Menu: [Scene Management](./extensions/scene-management/intro.md) 
- Power-ups: [Resources](./extensions/resources//intro.md) 


Here are some subjects we eventually plan to add:
- Godot's UI framework
- Shaders 
- CPU/GPU particles
- Audio
- Serialization

> If there's any topic you think we should include here, make a issue or pull request! You can also just ask an officer on discord.

# Adding your own mechanic!

We also encourage you to try to implement features yourself! You are ready to venture out into the REAL world (the internet and docs) and do cool stuff on your own. Here are some possible ideas:
- Health Bar
- Limited disks, i.e you have to go around picking them up
- Power ups
- Title screens and other UI
- New attacks
- More levels, level system

This is your turn to get creative. If you are ever confused about or aren't sure about how to achieve something, you can consult the [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/). Google is your best friend. 

> If you are really stuck, you can always ask an officer for advice on our Discord.

When you are done with this, you may follow our [GitHub guide](./git-setup.md) to easily share your work with an officer!
