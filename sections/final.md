# Adding your own mechanic!

Congrats on finishing the actual tutorial! Now that you are familiar with the components of the Godot editor and some typical conventions, you are ready to venture out into the REAL world (the internet and docs) and do stuff by yourself. Add something to the game of your choosing. Some ideas include:
- Health Bar
- Limitied disks, i.e you have to go around picking them up
- Power ups
- Title screens and other UI
- New attcks
- More levles, level system

This is your turn to get creative. If you are ever confused about or aren't sure about how to achieve something, make sure to consult the [godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/). Google is your best friend. 

> If you are really stuck, you can always ask an officer for advice on our Discord.

When you are done with this, you may follow our [GitHub guide](./git-setup.md) to easily share your work with an officer!
